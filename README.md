# Project Title: Uber Rides and Weather
Data Cleaning and Processing
Initial data cleaning and processing were performed for both Uber and Weather data.
All CSV files needed for processing are located in the “Raw_Data” folder. However, due to the large size of Uber data files, I am only transferring the concatenated NOAA weather CSV file to “Raw_Data” folder. 

Below are all the files used in the process:
Uber Data – 6 CSV files
•	uber-raw-data-apr14.csv
•	uber-raw-data-may14.csv
•	uber-raw-data-jun14.csv
•	uber-raw-data-jul14.csv
•	uber-raw-data-aug14.csv
•	uber-raw-data-sep14.csv

Weather Data: (I concatenated all 6 weather CSV files that Greg shared with us. Please feel free to use this file for your work. It in “Zahra/Rawdata folder”) 

•	NOAA_NewYork_Apr_Sep_2014.csv 

  
Processing Steps
1.	Uber Data:
o	The Uber data was concatenated from all 6 CSV files.
o	Data was cleaned and formatted for further analysis.
2.	Weather Data:
o	The weather data was formatted to merge with the Uber data.
o	
3.	Merged Both Uber and Weather data

## Project Description
For this project, we will explore the ‘Uber Pickups in New York City’ data for 2014 available from Kaggle, and investigate what effect weather conditions had on ride demand (Uber usage).

## Outline of Research Questions to Answer
1.	Correlation Analysis
  - How does weather affect the demand for Uber rides?
  - Is there a significant correlation between specific weather conditions (e.g., high or low temperatures, rain, snow) and the number of Uber rides?

2. Time-Based Analysis:
  - Are there seasonal trends in Uber usage that correlate with weather patterns?
  -	How does the time of day or day of the week impact Uber ride frequency in different weather conditions?

3. Location-Based Analysis:
  -	Are certain areas more affected by weather changes in terms of Uber demand?

4. Surge pricing:
  - Under what circumstances is Uber more likely to increase trip prices?

## Datasets to Be Used
